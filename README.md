#We have four methods in this example:

- For the `Summary` method, we can select any dataset to show its summary.

- For the `NA Check` method, we can get a table to show the number of NA value and the number of normal value.

- For the `Frequency Distortion method` we can show the frequency distortion in one or two column.

- For the `Box Plot` method, we choose some column to draw box plot in the selected dataset.
